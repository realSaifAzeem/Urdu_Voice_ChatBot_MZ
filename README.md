AI Voice Assistant 🎙️
This project is an AI Voice Assistant that allows users to interact in real-time using voice input in Urdu. The assistant processes speech input, converts it into text, interacts with an AI model, and provides responses in Urdu. The assistant can also convert the AI's response back into speech for a complete conversational experience.

Voice Input: The app captures speech input in Urdu and converts it to text.
Urdu Responses: The AI assistant responds to queries in Urdu.
Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts the AI's responses from text back to speech in Urdu, enabling a full conversational flow.
Streamed Responses: Real-time, streamed responses from the AI as the conversation unfolds.
Chat History: Keeps track of the conversation history to maintain context across interactions.
Technology Stack
LangChain: Manages prompts, chat history, and chain functionality.
Google Generative AI: Leverages Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5 Flash) for intelligent responses.
